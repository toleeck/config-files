My reverse proxy is configured in a dedicated container inside the proxmox6 (1 cpu, 512 Mb ram).
Here are the configuration files for the services that I throw out.
Also settings for port-forwarding on Mikrotik.
I have a wild-card configured to receive https certificates. Each service has a third-level domain.
